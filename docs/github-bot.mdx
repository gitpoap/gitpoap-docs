GitPOAP has built an opt-in GitHub bot that has two functions:

- Real-time awarding & notifications: for each PR that earns the contributor a GitPOAP, the bot will automatically detect & immediately reward a GitPOAP. It'll post a nice [note](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/8135#issuecomment-1265580429) and it will only post once per contributor per year. Without this, it takes a couple hours for your GitPOAPs to be awarded.
- Ad-hoc awarding: a maintainer can tag the bot to award your GitPOAP to anyone deserving (eg submitted a valuable Issue), so you are no longer limited to merged PRs. For example: `Nice job @wackerow! Here's a GitPOAP to show our apprecition @gitpoap-bot`

## Function

GitPOAP has built an opt-in GitHub bot that has two functions.

### Notifications

The bot will automatically detect merged PRs and post a notification [comment](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/8135#issuecomment-1265580429) only when the PR makes a contributor eligible for the first time that year. Without the bot, it takes a few hours for your GitPOAPs to be awarded.

### Awarding GitPOAPs at-will

A maintainer can tag the bot to award your GitPOAP to anyone deserving (eg submitted a valuable Issue), so you are no longer limited to merged PRs.<br />
_For example:_<br />
`Nice job @wackerow! Here's a GitPOAP to show our appreciation @gitpoap-bot`

## Example notification

<ImageContainer>
  <img
    src={require('@site/static/img/gitpoap_bot/example-comment.png').default}
    style={{
      width: '1000px',
      maxWidth: '100%',
      textAlign: 'center',
    }}
  />
</ImageContainer>
<br />
<br />

And that's it! Now gitpoap-bot will start notifying users when their merged PRs have
earned them new GitPOAPs.

## Enabling GitPOAP notifications

GitPOAP notifications are enabled by default once the bot is installed, so there is nothing additional you need to do. If you'd like them to be disabled you can either uninstall the bot or reach out to our team on our [discord](https://gitpoap.io/discord) and we can disable it so you can still use the tagging functionality.

## Tagging contributors

Gitpoap-bot also has the capability to issue GitPOAPs to contributors by tagging them in a
comment. When both `@gitpoap-bot` and one or more contributors' handles are tagged within a comment
on a PR or Issue, a new GitPOAP claim will be issued to these users if they don't have one already.

For example, to issue a new GitPOAP to a GitHub user via a PR or Issue, add a comment with `@gitpoap-bot` tagged like so:

<ImageContainer>
  <img
    src={require('@site/static/img/gitpoap_bot/sample-tagging-comment.png').default}
    style={{
      width: '1000px',
      maxWidth: '100%',
      textAlign: 'center',
    }}
  />
</ImageContainer>
