### What’s the purpose of the community calls?

GitPOAP wants to support open source projects - that means giving projects the tools to reward their contributors and also connecting potential new contributors to projects actively seeking them.

**We want contributors to feel like they have an entry point to contribute to these projects**. The audience will get to know the maintainer and the project - we’ll help get context for what it does, how it works, and specifically what they’re seeking contributions on.

### What do the calls look like?

POAP generously hosts our community call livestreams on [the POAP youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvXWjomx55gbEjJ3PCPPezQ/streams). They are also published as podcasts and are available with your favorite podcast app. Will there be a POAP? Always!

Calls generally go something like:

- GitPOAP intro and updates
- Guest intro
- Project overview
- How can contributors get involved?

Chatter during the call happens in the [GitPOAP’s discord](https://www.gitpoap.io/discord) #general channel.
