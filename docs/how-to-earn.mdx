### _I want a GitPOAP but I’m not sure where to start_

## First: What is a GitPOAP?

A GitPOAP is a special kind of POAP that signals that you worked on a project. **These are most commonly earned with software contributions on Github**. If you create a pull request that gets merged in [an eligible repo](https://www.gitpoap.io/repos), you’ll automatically become eligible to mint a GitPOAP.

## Not a developer? That’s okay!

Some projects have elected to give out GitPOAPs for their non-software contributors, too. These can be earned with translations, documentation, design work - it’s up to the project maintainer to determine exactly what counts toward a GitPOAP.

## Your best methods

First: **Earning a GitPOAP is not easy, simple, or quick!** GitPOAPs are meant to be badges that show off the fact that you put in effort to help a project succeed. These are not earned by simply asking for them or showing up. **GitPOAPs are earned with work**.

1. **Identify a project that you’re interested in**. This is the most important step! We want to help you work on what you love and be recognized for it.
   1. For example, if you’re already engaged in a DAO, see if that DAO offers GitPOAPs for contributions - design work, community management, consistently help out new people over a long period of time, etc.
   2. If they don’t already have GitPOAPs, _gently_ encourage the maintainers to create a GitPOAP that represents the DAO and its contributors. The goal is to help the project - if they’re spending too much time on GitPOAPs, it distracts from their ability to build the project.
2. If you’re already very familiar with a project, there’s a lot you can do to try to earn a GitPOAP. Ask the maintainer how you can help and earn a GitPOAP - maintainers and project leaders usually know what they need!
3. If you’re very familiar with the project, go check out their docs and see if they’re up-to-date! Maintainers often write docs once and struggle to keep them updated. If they changed the way something works, a command structure, an APR, or moved a page - sometimes that information doesn’t get updated in the docs! This is your chance to help the project succeed and also earn a GitPOAP.

   Docs are often housed on Github - you don’t need to know how to code to use Github and update docs! Ask the maintainers “Hey, I noticed some out-of-date info on the docs, is it okay if I make a PR to fix that info?” - and then you can [learn how to make a PR on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ)!

### Remember

The point of GitPOAPs are to help projects succeed and recognize the people who make it possible for them to do so. We want to see more contributors to projects and we want to recognize the work that it takes to help a project succeed. This is mutually beneficial for the contributor and the project: a contributor earning GitPOAPs can show them off on a reputation site (e.g. mazury.xyz) or use them to get perks or vote on GitPOAP-gated votes.

You are very likely to succeed if you show that you’re willing to earn some GitPOAPs by putting in some work!
