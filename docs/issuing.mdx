You can tailor your use of GitPOAP to meet your specific needs. No matter what roles you want to reward, GitPOAP can help you provide recognition and portable reputation for them.

**Custom GitPOAPs** are the standard GitPOAP and can be used to reward a variety of roles:

- Project leads
- Project managers
- Designers
- Translators
- Community managers
- Researchers

The initial setup for these GitPOAPs require artwork, a title, and a short and sweet description of accomplishment that you’re recognizing. You’ll then be able add in your contributors for eligibility by Github handle, Ethereum address (ENS supported), or email address.

**Github-based GitPOAPs** are annual GitPOAPs that are awarded automatically based on merged pull requests. It doesn’t matter if these are code, documentation, typo fixes, etc. If it’s a pull request being merged, this is a good option. Roles often rewarded here are:

- Code contributors
- Documentation writers / editors

Repos applying to issue GitPOAPs to contributors should meet some eligibility requirements before being onboarded:

- There should be at least 2 contributors
- There should be a minimum of 3 months of Github history
- README.md should clearly explain what the project is
- Project should be live (**_exception_**: if the maintainer has an extensive history of previous projects, brand new projects can be submitted)
- Hackathons should use Custom GitPOAPs rather than Github-based GitPOAPs

If your project is new and doesn’t meet these criteria, feel free to reach out to us at **team@gitpoap.io**
