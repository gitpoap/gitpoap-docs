## Custom

Custom GitPOAPs are the standard GitPOAP. These allow you to recognize **any kind of contributor** and curate eligibility based on your own standards of contribution. These can be project managers, designers, researchers, community managers, translators, programmers, or any other person who makes contributions that your Team would like to recognize.

## Github-based

These annual GitPOAPs are based on **merged pull requests** in **public repos** in that you designate. This process is automatic - our systems will sweep your repo for newly merged pull requests every six hours and add in eligibility for new contributors.

Annual GitPOAPs are based on the year that the pull request is merged - that means that a contributor is eligible to claim a GitPOAP for every calendar year that they had a pull request merged. This is also retroactive - a user who had a pull request merged in 2016 will become eligible for a 2016 Your Team GitPOAP.
