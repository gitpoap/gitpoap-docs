You can use the Custom GitPOAP feature to create GitPOAPs for your hackathon! Past hackathon facilitators have chosen to create two GitPOAPs:

1. A GitPOAP for any participant who submitted a valid project for consideration <br />
   _Example_: [2022 StarkNet MatchboxDAO Hackathon Participant](https://www.gitpoap.io/gp/650)
2. A GitPOAP for the hackathon winners <br />
   _Example_: [2022 StarkNet MatchboxDAO Hackathon Winner](https://www.gitpoap.io/gp/651)

Hackathon GitPOAPs should be issued by facilitators of the hackathon, for the hackathon as a whole, and not by participants for their individual projects. If you submitted a project to a hackathon and would like it to be recognized, consider reaching out to the facilitators of the hackathon and asking them to issue GitPOAPs to participants.
