# Design Guidelines & Requirements

GitPOAP designs are meant to evoke the core idea or ethos of the project with a combination of the branding and visual style.

We’ve created a Canva GitPOAP design template located [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFQoFm0dhQ/H17FASlR17kwLk6m303hBw/view?utm_content=DAFQoFm0dhQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview) to provide an easy way to create a nice design if you’re in a pinch!

### Aesthetic Requirements

- Should feature the logo and/or branding of the project
- Must include the following text **_(Only for Annual Contributor GitPOAPs)_**:
  - "[Year] [Project Name] Contributor" e.g: "2021 StakeHouse Contributor"
  - Use this template as the border and feel free to change the color to match your design: [GitPOAP Design Template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14MjNEeGDxlnRV0REGEwDGDkcwtuBKA8a?usp=sharing)
- Include no white space around the POAP design
  - e.g. Make sure templates edges are aligned
  - Here’s an example of what the borders should look like when finalized!
